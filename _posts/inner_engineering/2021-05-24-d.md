### My whole experience of life has always been in this moment

- Unfortunately, my mind is never in this moment
- If I am aware--with conscious, positive, dynamic acceptance of what is there "right now"
- Happiness is the only way I can be

### Fully accepting whatever is there in "this" moment will result in happiness

- For "this moment--now" is inevitable
- For "this moment" can only happen once, what happens "next" has a zillion possibilities
- Hence, this moment "right now" is an absolutely unique moment and inevitable

### If you are accepting what is there right now, that is the end of suffering

- Pain is only physical and suffering is mental
- However, suffering is my making
- Because whatever happens on a physical realm, I **_magnify_** it in my mind

### By accepting this moment, creating the next moment is in your hands

- Anything you accept becomes a part of you
- Anything you do not accept, ends up being against you
