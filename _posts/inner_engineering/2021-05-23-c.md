### Responsibility is the ability to respond

- Responsibility = ability to respond
- My responsibility is un-limited and my action (karma) is limited
- Hence, being responsible gives me freedom

### Responding consciously to everything

- Starting from the air I breathe to external events and creation
- Life is the ability to respond
- For instance, I inhale the air which trees exhale.
