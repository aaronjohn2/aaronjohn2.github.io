### Sustainable ecstasy can be obtained through inner engineering

- If I am at peace and blissful from within, nothing on the outside can cause me to feel miserable
- Because I have engineered myself in such a way that I will experience perpetual ecstasy

### My definition of a high quality life

- In my body I perceive health and pleasure
- In my mind I feel peace and joy
- In my emotions I cultivate love and compassion
- As for my energy... I surround it with bliss and ecstasy
- This is what I call living a high quality life.

### Distinct forms of meditation

- Starting from toe to head: during inhalation... tense the muscle and relax the muscle during exhalation
- Isha Kriya
- Uttering AUM
- Conscious breathing 
- Praying the rosary (or any contemplative prayer that connects one with god)
