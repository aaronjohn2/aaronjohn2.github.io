### The mechanics of the mind

- Is about understanding that everything that you are is your making

### The mind may be divided into 4 parts

- Vinyana = Cognition
- Sanya = Recognition
- Vedana = Sensation
- Sankara = Reaction

### Fully accepting at the sensation

- At the Vedana (Sensation) simply accept the sense
- Do not discriminate as like or dislike
- This will result in an equanimous mind

### Diminishing past karma bondages

- By fully accepting the sensation that comes in "this" moment
- Past Karma bondages will start to diminish
- Where Karma is the conditioning of the mind by past references
