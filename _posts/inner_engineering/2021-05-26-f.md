### Love should Not be on push-start

- Why should it take another person to trigger the emotion of love?
- Rather, it should be on "self"-start

### Get involved with life

- The reason it is on push-start for most people is because they are not involved with life
- In order get involved with life, I need to be consciously aware of the "rules of my surroundings" and make it mine
- When I make the "rules of my surroundings" my own, I become one with it
- Hence, this results in complete involvement

### Raise your human consciousness

- Isolate the psychological ideas you have accumulated and get involved with life
- Meditation is a simple tool to help with raising your consciousness
- When you become meditative, there is a distance between you and the mind
- Once there is a distance, you see life as just the way it is

### Simply be

- Meditation has increased the quality of my 5 senses, thus improving the "inner" quality of my life
- Once you have mastered the "how to be"… the "how to do" will naturally come to you

### Changes I have noticed within myself

- Now that I have created ecstasy as a background of my life
- I am able to consciously go into the memory of grief or pain and come back to “this” moment
- Now that my life experience has become pleasant
- I do most activities with complete consciousness

### Consistently remind yourself
- My responsibility is limitless
- This moment is inevitable
- This body and mind is an accumulation and is not Me
- The most intelligent way to live is in a pleasant way (refer to your desires, do they create pleasantness?)
- As soon as you wake up be joyful and grateful that you're alive (there are many in the world who did not wake up today!)
