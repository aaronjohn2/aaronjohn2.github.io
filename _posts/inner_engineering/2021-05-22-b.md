### I am not the body, I am not even the mind

- The mistake most people make is identifying themselves with physicality
- Free yourself from the body and mind--for it(body/mind) is something you have accumulated overtime, and it is not your true identity

### Desire is the root cause of suffering

- Learning to desire consciously and not compulsively is key
- If you consciously desire, you will merely act and will not react to externals
- Because reaction is letting the external define how you exist

### Desire is boundless, so choose your desires wisely

- The energy you call desire and you call life is the same thing
- If there is no desire, there is no life

### Desire so that the result is Health, Peace, Joy, Love and Compassion
