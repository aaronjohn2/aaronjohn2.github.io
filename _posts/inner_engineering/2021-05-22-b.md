### I am not the body, I am not even the mind

- The mistake most people make is identifying themselves with physicality
- I should free myself from the body and mind
- For it (body/mind) is something I have accumulated over time and it is not my true identity

### Desire is the root cause of suffering

- Learning to desire consciously and not compulsively is key
- If I am consciously desiring, I will merely act and I will not react to externals
- Because reaction is letting the external define how I exist

### Desire is boundless, so choose your desires wisely

- The energy you call desire and you call life is the same thing. If there is no desire there is no life

### Desire so that the result is Health, Peace, Joy, Love, Compassion, Bliss and Ecstasy
