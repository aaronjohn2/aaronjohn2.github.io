Copied this from Quora onto my notes (in the past.) Author is unknown.
Reposting since it resonates with me.

### 1.Learning to play an instrument.

- A highly rewarding experience that'll frustrate and delight you in equal parts.

### 2.Taking risks.

- If you don't try, you'll never know. 
- Plus, those who never made a mistake never made anything…

### 3.The newspaper crossword.

- It'll help to build your vocabulary and, more importantly, your patience.

### 4.Learning to drive.

- It'll give you independence and allow you to travel. 
- If you can afford to do it, it's a no brainer.

### 5.Playing video games.

- Video games get a lot of bad press, but I've had some incredibly enriching experiences and learnt a lot along the way, too.

### 6.Watching live music, sports, etc.

- There's nothing better than supporting your home town team or feeling the buzz of singing your favorite songs along with thousands of like-minded people.

### 7.Falling in love.

- We all know the deal with this one. 
- It comes to most of us in one way or another and at various points in life. 
- Just go with it.

### 8.Having your heart broken.

- Yep, numbers 7 and 8 go together hand in hand, pretty much. 
- What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, eh!

### 9.Pursuing new hobbies.

- If something interests you, give it a go! 
- You never know where it might take you. 
- It could even end up being your new career.

### 10.Reading.

- We constantly see this mentioned on Quora, and for good reason, too! 
- Knowledge is power, and the more you have, the better off you'll be.

### 11.Taking a walk.

- It helps to clear your mind and, in the right environment, it can reconnect you with nature. 
- Plus, it functions as good exercise.

### 12.Doing something random.

- I heard in a talk recently that if you stay in on a Saturday night, chances are, your dream girl isn’t going to knock on the door. 
- You don’t say?! So, get out there. Give yourself a chance, and do something different!

### 13.Writing.

- It doesn't have to be War and Peace, but try writing a blog, an answer on Quora, or a post on LinkedIn. 
- Get good at expressing yourself, as communication is key in all aspects of life!

### 14.Traveling.

- Staying in the same town / city you were born in does you no favors! 
- Get out there and see the world, even if it’s just to other towns and cities in your own country.

### 15.Indulging in a guilty pleasure.

- By indulging in a guilty pleasure I mean having a bar of chocolate or your favorite treat now and then. 
- Keep it clean!

### 16.Getting out of your comfort zone.

- We all get stuck in ruts from time to time. 
- Sometimes, you've gotta get out of your cage, to semi-quote The Killers. 
- You’ll do just fine. ;)

### 17.Making mistakes.

- I know I alluded to this in no.2, but it really is important. 
- If you don't make mistakes then you'll never try anything new.

### 18.Taking time to recharge.

- Modern life is fast-paced and can be overwhelming at times. 
- Take frequent breaks and rest your body and mind.

### 19.Learning to let go.

- Does this one really need explaining?

### 20.Taking a moment to appreciate the small things. 

- When you think about it, so many events had to happen for us to even exist here on this small speck of dust called Earth. 
- Take a moment to look up and appreciate the moon and stars; your family members around you, and the little things that make life worth living.
