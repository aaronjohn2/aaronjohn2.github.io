### Trade or HODL?

- In my last two years of trading in a crypto market, I have done scalp, day, swing and position trades
- However, what I have come to realize is that the big money I made was through HODL (Holding On for Dear Life)
- A quote from Jesse Livermore, "It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting."

### The HODL concept is simple

- I buy crypto(s) and hold it for a long period of time (for months/years)
- To break it down... 
- I buy at an accumulation phase
- HODL = hold for a long peiod of time
- Distribute at a planned sell target (distribution is based on the presence of historical data)
- If there is no historical data: distribute at a (decided) level break of laddering pattern
- If there is historical data: distribute before opposing pressure

Also, I strictly follow these rules:

- [x] Draw levels and patterns
- [x] Being a little late in a trade is insurance that my opinion is correct
- [x] Therefore, **wait for momentum and volume confirmation**
- [x] Always: **Manage risk, Stop loss, and Take profit**
- [x] Note: attempting to catch the extreme top or bottom of a momentum is a gamble
- [x] Therefore, **_always_** set **“conservative”** buy/sell Targets! (based on levels)

### Always pre-determine exit

- Stressing on this again!
- Pre-determine your exit when your head is clear... and stick to it!
- You'll make profitable trades on the long term
- Most prominently, you will save yourself from emotional suffering caused by avarice

### What happens if I see a lovely swing trade opportunity?

- I take it!

I use the following technical analysis:
- Break and hold levels (find ranges and trade in it)
- Trendlines (wedges)
- Cycles and distribution
- Candle stick patterns
- Volume confirmation
- Stop listening to anyone but my charts

Other patterns to look for:
- Ascending triangle
- Above EMA
- Base of cup and handle
- Holding level range
- Reduced volatility
- Level exhaustion (my favorite one)

### Buy the rumor sell the news

- This is another swing trade strategy I use, if my TA chart looks promising
