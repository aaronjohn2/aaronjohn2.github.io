"The past is your lesson. The present is your gift. The future is your motivation."

### 1. Simplicity

- "Always choose simplicity over complexity."
- You need to build your own system, no one will help you there
- Trading live is the only way to give your brain experience

Complicated strategy won't work.
High complication = No execution
Strategy needs to be simple to execute.

### 2. Losses

- You need to learn how to accept Losses
- Not all trades will go your way
- You will make losses and profits. It's all part of the game
- Your attitude towards it will show if you have what it takes to succeed

Remember, "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor."

### 3. Acceptance

- Trade the setups and not think that you can dictate which way the market will go
- Accept that risk is a part of trading
- Create a system that consistently makes you money

Create money with a system and not with luck or gambling.
Understand?

### 4. Possibility

- Remember, there's always a possibility that a set-up will fail, even if the chart looks good
- Always keep that in mind when looking for setups
- Much like life, not everything will go our way
- Be realistic, but don't let the fear of failure stop you from achieving greatness

Preserving capital is imperative.
How will you make more $ if there is no capital left?

### 5. Fear

- Risk low and keep clicking, you will grow an edge
- Get in the zone of not being Fearful about Trading

Fearful = Too high of a position size

- You will get rich if You go slow
- No need to rush and risk your sanity

### 6. Adapt

- Align with the trend
- Attempting to "predict" price targets is hard
- Rather, plan exits at increments
- Not adapting to new information will cost you big money

New rules all the time.

- You WILL sometimes exit too early
- Your winning trades will feel too small of a position size
- It WILL happen over and over against

Accept this misery.
Get used to it.

### 7. Personality

- You need to think rationally when trading, but you shouldn't work against yourself
- Use your personality in your favor
- Are you a fast-paced adrenaline junkie? Then try scalping
- Do you have a hard time dealing with stress? Then go for position trading

You can't be a good trader if you're not a calm person in general.

- Master you emotions
- Your ability to stay emotionally in check determines your profits

### 8. Community

- Don't be a community member or fight for a coin
- You are here to make money
- There's no good coin or bad coin
- Trade coins that make you money and forget the opinion of others

### 9. Inference

June 2021, I lost over 80% of my gains.
How did I keep going after losing so much?
- I had no choice
- I had given too much time to Trading
- I did not want to go back to a normal job

How did I get back up:
- Turned of all external noise (opinions on social media- Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube)
- I have endured the pain of listening to others
- As a result, I have lost so much money
- Don't listen to anyone, including me

### 10. Hints

- Make a trading plan; when and how will I trade?

- Weekend routine:
1. Clear all charts
2. Review the previous week; What did I do good?
3. What were my mistakes?
4. What do my losses and wins have in common?

- Never let a good size gain turn into a loss

- So many ways to make $$ in crypto:
1. Investing
2. Staking
3. Swing Trading
4. Leverage Trading
5. Lending and Borrowing
5. Aping in shitcoins

- Investment tip:
1. "Find projects you will hold for life and keep buying."
2. "Alts are for making big gains, Bitcoin is for keeping the gains!"

- Final word:
"If you put in the work and don't quit you will be successful."
