Hi world~

I am a seeker, engineer and athlete. 

This blog organises my thoughts on mindfulness and my reading/study notes.

Currently, I focus on projects that keep me in a constant state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flow</a>.

My hobbies and interests are learning, traveling, health, fitness and cooking.
